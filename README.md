# BME590final

## Description 
This project was completed as a final project for the course BME590 MEedical Software Design. 
The project was completed Dr. Jason Luck, a professor of Biomechanics at Duke University. 

Client: Jason Luck, PhD (Injury Biomechanics Laboratory)
Contact information: jfl1@duke.edu

### Background 
Dr. Luck is leading a prospective study in the Raleigh-Durham community where youth athletes are instrumented with the DASHR: a novel, noninvasive sensor that uses industry-standard earpieces (e.g. hearing aids) in the bony canal to quantify head impact exposure. In association with head exposure data measured by the DASHR the research team is also completing both novel and traditional on- and off-field injury assessments to assist with quantifying the symptomology of participants from concussive and cumulative sub-concussive insults to the pediatric brain.


### Client Need
Hardware and software solution that accepts multiple HIE sensors simultaneously to accommodate downloading of HIE data from the devices to a central storage unit. 

### Functional Specifications
Software toolkit (GUI) [Python] to facilitate all aspects of downloading, logging and storage management.

*Download data (binary files) from multiple devices simultaneously (using a hub )

*Store downloaded data in folders associated with specific HIE device (each device will be associated with a unique PIN number)

*Store data by the date HIE data was acquired 

*Ability for client to download variable number of devices

*Post-download log report 

*Flexibility to interface with a database (i.e. SQL) and NTFS file system. All data is associated with a unique PIN and these data include the HIE sensor data that is the focus of the current document but also includes additional assessment and background data.
